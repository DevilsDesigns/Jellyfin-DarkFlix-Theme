<h4>**This is still a WIP. So please know that ahead of time**</h4>
**This uses Netflix Sans from the official netflix CSS. If I am violating any copyright agrement then please don't ban this repo but make an issue for it.
Warning: This css is only for Jellyfin 10.6.X.<br>
Note: Finally!! This CSS is fully supported now in Firefox and other browsers, but it may not have the blur features instead it would be barkened as firefox doesn't have backdrop-filter CSS tag supported, to use that you might have to manually enable the backdrop filter. I have given a way at the bottom.**
